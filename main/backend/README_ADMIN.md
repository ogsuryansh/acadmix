3. URLs are stored in the database
4. Old files are automatically deleted when updated

## API Endpoints

```

### Book Management
```
GET    /api/admin/books          # Get all books
POST   /api/admin/books          # Create new book (with file upload)
PUT    /api/admin/books/:id      # Update book (with file upload)
DELETE /api/admin/books/:id      # Delete book
```

### Payment Management
```

## File Upload Flow

### Frontend (React)
1. User selects files using HTML file input
2. Files are validated for type and size
3. FormData is created with files and book data
4. POST request sent to backend

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
1. Multer middleware processes file uploads
2. Files are uploaded to Cloudinary
3. URLs are stored in MongoDB
4. Response includes book data with file URLs

### Cloud Storage (Cloudinary)
1. Files are automatically organized in folders
2. Images are optimized and transformed
3. PDFs are stored as raw files
4. Secure URLs are generated

## Security Features

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types
- **Size Limits**: Prevents large file uploads
- **Virus Scanning**: Cloudinary provides basic scanning
- **Secure URLs**: HTTPS URLs only

### Admin Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure admin access
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse

## Deployment (Vercel)

### Environment Variables
Set the following in Vercel:
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `MONGO_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_USER`
- `ADMIN_PASS`

### File Upload Considerations
- **Vercel Limitations**: No local file storage
- **Cloud Storage**: All files stored in Cloudinary
- **Memory Usage**: Files processed in memory
- **Timeout**: Large files may timeout (consider chunked uploads)
